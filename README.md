OData Library (Java)
====================

Introduction
------------

### What is it about? ###

The [Open Data Protocol (OData)](http://odata.org) is a Web protocol for querying and updating data that provides a way to unlock your data and free it from silos that exist in applications today. OData does this by applying and building upon Web technologies such as HTTP, Atom Publishing Protocol (AtomPub) and JSON to provide access to information from a variety of applications, services, and stores.

The OData Library (Java) is a library which enables developers to implement OData producers and OData consumers and adheres to the following principles:

- Provide an OData 2.0 specification compliant OData Library (Java) 
- Enhancements shall be possible in a compatible manner 
- Clear separation between Core and API 
- Option to build extensions on top

Maven
-----

The project build with Maven. To consume sources execute 

    mvn eclipse:eclipse
